### FWW & FWA - Important Plugin Note:
> [!TIP]
> When reviewing the backend setup of the plugin on both site's the build out of the Promo-Types doesn't always look the same, ie. FWW you need to add the CSS for the One-Col styling, on FWA that is hardcoded into the plugin. This is because the Plugin needs to be built differently to adapt to each client's website and theme. It will never be a 1:1 universal experience for everyone.
