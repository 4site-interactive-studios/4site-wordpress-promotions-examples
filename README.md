# 4Site Studios - WordPress Promotions Plugin

While working with various clients hosted on WordPress, we kept implementing custom solutions for them to launch fundraising lightboxes, signup lightboxes, and other engagement tools. Eventually, we bundled them all together into what we call the **"Promotions Plugin"**. This plugin integrates with our Engaging Networks forms to create seamless user experiences along with offering a number of standalone promotions you can run.

## Features

### Promotion Types
- **EN Multistep Lightbox**:  
  Our multistep donation lightbox creates a seamless giving experience with an embedded Engaging Networks page. Can be configured to support non-donation page types as well.  
  [Example](https://apps.4sitestudios.com/fernando/peta/multistep-lightbox/video/) <!-- Add link to example -->

- **EN Lightbox**:  
  Similar to the Multistep Lightbox, but the entire embedded Engaging Networks page is visible as a single step.

- **CTA Lightbox**:  
  A lightbox featuring one or more calls to action with the ability to customize its styling.

- **Overlay**:  
  Similar to the CTA Lightbox but with multiple predefined donation options. When clicked, it redirects the user to the target donation page with the selected gift amount pre-populated.

- **Pushdown**:  
  Pushes down the entire website and places a promotion above it.

- **Roll Up**:  
  Provides a small modal that appears near the bottom of the screen and follows the user as they scroll until the modal is closed out.

- **Floating Tab**:  
  A tab that appears on the side of your website, customizable with an on-hover animation. It can either link to a page or trigger another promotion like the Multistep Donation Lightbox.  
  [Example](https://cln.sh/Vd2Qg3Fr) <!-- Add link to example -->

- **Raw Code**:  
  Lets you run any code you like. Great for running third-party services or rolling your own A/B testing to trigger other promotions randomly to test different variants.

### Additional Features
- **Scheduling**:  
  You can schedule your promotions to run down to the minute! Includes out-of-the-box support for Cloudflare Cache busting, allowing you to plan your campaigns and promotions ahead of time. Everything runs on autopilot without the need to log in and manually deploy or remove a promotion.

- **EN Shortcode and Gutenberg Support**:  
  The Promotions Plugin includes its own shortcodes and Gutenberg block so you can embed any EN page built with our ENgrid page template framework inline with your content. Context is king, and this feature allows you to include your action alongside the call to it, removing the need to link off to dedicated pages.

- **User-Friendly Interface for Content Admins**:
