# 2024 Giving Tuesday Countdown Timer A/B Test 

## Overview
Control of no countdown timer added vs. 24 hour countdown timer that resets every day until Giving Tuesday ( Dec. 3 2024). Final Report available here [2024 AIUSA GT Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L9fh98CDp1wRbVRQE1VrUyV-ubHvRpgYm1bZY0LT7q4/edit?usp=sharing)

Test launched Monday Nov. 25, 2024 and ran until Dec. 2, 2024. 

The data was inconclusive as it did not qaulify as statisctically significant. However, the decision to rollout the countdown timer for Giving Tuesday was made on our recommendation:

### Data from Nov. 25 - Dec. 2, 2024

**Overall:**
The total amount raised so far was $9,270.
- The control test (no countdown timer) raised $5,570
- The test group (with countdown timer) raised $3,520

At first glance the Control (without the timer) looks as if it is outperforming the Test with the total revenue raised at $5,570 compared to $3,520. However, the Control's higher total could be driven by two "larger" donations of $3,000 and $1,000. The Test had one $1,000 donation. Excluding these, the Test actually surpasses the Control in revenue (albeit not by much), while also maintaining a slightly higher average gift size ($74.81 versus $71.36).

***Removing the "large" gifts (anything that is $1k or over)***

### Control form (No countdown)
- Total $1,570.00 
- Number of Gifts 22
- Avg Gift Amount $71.36 

### Test (countdown)
- Total $2,020.00 (+450 increase)
- Number of Gifts $27.00 
- Avg Gift Amount $74.81 
 
I recommend pausing the test and focusing solely on the countdown timer variation for Giving Tuesday and the extension. The countdown takes advantage of the dayâ€™s natural urgency to prompt immediate action from donors who are already thinking of giving. And even if only showing a slight advantage, the data still suggests the countdown is more effective at boosting revenue overall. 

I don't believe this will interfere with the plan to extend to the 4th either, because the countdown will restart on the 4th it still creates urgency for those who might have missed GT. Lastly, most of [your visitors are new,](https://cln.sh/F1RNbtvF) and are unlikely to have seen the promo on the 3rd without making a donation. Which makes the countdown an even more effective tool for encouraging action among these new visitors.
